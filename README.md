# Snapback

This is code that I use to automatically backup my laptop to
a btrfs drive when it's plugged in, with no manual effort required.

I wrote [an article](http://pjf.id.au/tech/2014/01/23/automated-backups-with-udev-and-btrfs.html) about this you may find useful.

This code is provided as-is, and will need customisations before
it will work on your system.
